Restaurant Menu Page
Your task is to create a simple restaurant menu page that displays different food categories and their items. Use CSS to style the page by applying various selectors. You should style all headings to have distinct font sizes and fonts, and apply consistent padding and borders to each menu item. Highlight special dishes and spicy items by targeting them with appropriate selectors. Make sure prices are visually distinct and aligned differently from the dish names. Add interactive styling so that menu items change appearance when hovered over. Use the universal selector to ensure consistent box-sizing across the page. Focus on practicing element, class, ID, attribute, descendant, pseudo-class, and universal selectors to build a clean, readable, and user-friendly menu layout.
